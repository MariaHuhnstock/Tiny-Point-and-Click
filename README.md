# **Tiny-Point-and-Click**
This project was created as part of a university assignment. The task was to design two game scenes and implement a transition between them. I chose to approach this in the style of a 2D point-and-click game, where players interact with the environment by clicking on objects.

Both scenes are hand-drawn by me. The main interaction is a clickable door that connects the two scenes and demonstrates scene transitions. The goal of this prototype is not to build a full game, but to showcase the fundamentals of interactive scene design, navigation, and player interaction.
